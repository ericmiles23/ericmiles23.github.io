            <p>
                Advertising is a truly fascinating field. A place where marketers
                try to determine the best way to get their products, ideas, and
                messages in front of the right person at the right time. It is a
                constant process of trying to determine who are we are trying to talk
                to, how to talk to them, and what is the most engaging or enticing 
                way to make someone who is bombarded by thousands of ads a day
                listen to our message.
                <br /> <br />
                I joined this wonderfully challenging field in October of 2016 with
                AT&amp;T, one of the largest advertisers in the United States. Since
                then, I've had the pleasure of working to get AT&amp;T's B2B sector
                in front of business decision makers, their Corporate Sponsorship
                team to promote Brand Awareness and CSR efforts, and Cricket Wireless
                to drive customers who need affordable pre-paid plans to stores. As I've
                moved through the different areas of the business, I can officially
                say I am hooked. The social media space is ever-evolving, always
                keeps you on your toes, and offers new challenges every day and I
                love it.
                <br /> <br />
                Outside of work, I enjoy travelling and generally being outdoors,
                doing a variety of activites including ultimate frisbee, rock
                climbing, hiking, kayaking, and most recently cycling.
