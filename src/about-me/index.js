            <p>
                Advertising is a truly fascinating field. A place where marketers
                try to determine the best way to get their products, ideas, and
                messages in front of the right person at the right time. It is a
                constant process of trying to determine who are we are trying to talk
                to, how to talk to them, and what is the most engaging or enticing 
                way to make someone who is bombarded by thousands of ads a day
                listen to our message.
                <br /> <br />
                I joined this wonderfully challenging field in October of 2016 with
                one of the largest advertisers in the United States,
                AT&amp;T. After working to get AT&amp;T's B2B sector in front of
                decision makers and working with their Corporate Sponsorship teams
                for the last 3 years, I can officially say I am hooked. The social
                media space is ever-evolving, always keeps you on your toes, and
                offers new challenges every day and I love it.
                <br /> <br />
                Outside of work, I enjoy travelling and generally being outdoors,
                doing a variety of activites including ultimate frisbee, rock
                climbing, hiking, kayaking, and most recently cycling.
